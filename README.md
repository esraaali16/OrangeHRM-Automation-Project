## OrangeHRM – Web Automation Testing Project
---
# 1. Project Overview
---
This repository contains a complete web automation testing framework built to validate the core HR management functionalities of the OrangeHRM Demo Website. It focuses on creating a 
scalable and maintainable framework using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The suite covers various features of the application 
to ensure that the core functionalities work as expected.

The framework is designed to be data-driven, supports detailed logging, and generates reports for easy analysis. Screenshots are automatically captured after each test case execution, 
whether the test passes, fails, or is skipped.

The project automates the following OrangeHRM modules:
- **Login**
